# Tokenomics

## 1. What is SkyFleet Dash Token (SFDT) and What is it Used For?

**SkyFleet Dash Token (SFDT)** is the core utility and governance token in the SkyFleet Dash ecosystem, designed to fuel both the platform’s in-game economy and governance.  
*Through SFDT, SkyFleet Dash provides players, investors, and the community with opportunities to engage actively, make key decisions, and benefit from the platform’s long-term growth.*

### Key Uses of SFDT:

- **Access the SkyFleet Dash Platform:**  
Players use SFDT to enter competitive games, buy in-game items such as spaceships, weapons, and equipment, or upgrade their game avatars. As players participate in matches and tournaments, they have the opportunity to earn more SFDT as rewards for their performance.

- **Governance:**  
SFDT holders can participate in the governance of SkyFleet Dash through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure. Token holders can vote on key decisions such as game feature implementations, platform upgrades, and other major development plans.  
Players can also delegate their voting power to others if they choose.

- **Staking:**  
SFDT tokens can be staked by players to earn passive income. By staking SFDT, players can generate returns, and it also gives them access to premium rewards and other exclusive in-game benefits.  
Staking is an essential way for players to maximize the utility of their earned tokens.

- **Transaction Fees and Revenue Sharing:**  
A percentage of all transaction fees (5%) generated on the platform is redistributed among SFDT holders. Half of these fees go towards the staking pool to reward those who stake their tokens, while the other half goes to maintaining and developing the platform.

- **Foundation Support:**  
The SkyFleet Dash Foundation plays a crucial role in growing the ecosystem by offering grants and funding projects that enhance the platform.  
The foundation supports both game creators and community-driven initiatives, driving innovation and ensuring the platform continues to grow in value.
